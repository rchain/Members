1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,220
Brad: Hey guys, it’s blockchain Brad and today

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,170
we have two very special guests in

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,490
the house. We have none other than

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,390
Lawrence Lerner.

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,179
Hey Lawrence, how you going? Lawrence: Excellent. Brad: And

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,059
also we all, have Nash as well. So Nash

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,259
thank you so much for being on the

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,210
channel, we appreciate your time. Just a

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,710
bit of background for both of you, these

10
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,050
guys are the real deal, they are CEOs in

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,970
their own right. Lawrence is the CEO of

12
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,430
RChain holding company and if you want to

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,330
know more about that, there are many

14
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,619
different sources of information. I'm

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,090
gonna find it about some excellent and

16
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,650
amazing credentials about Lawrence in a

17
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,960
moment, but also Nash he has a long

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,610
history of business experience as well

19
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,440
and he is the CEO of a company called

20
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,200
Pyrofex. So both of you welcome, we are

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,629
very honored to have you. Let's talk

22
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,010
about your background briefly Lawrence.

23
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,540
I'm going to introduce you with some key

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,340
achievements you've made, then just give

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,260
us a bit about who you are and what

26
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,969
you've done, what you’ve achieved. So

27
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,309
Lawrence is amazing, he's done quite a

28
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:51,649
lot of things, he's had extensive

29
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,579
executive experience and when I read

30
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,190
through it I was amazed. The reason

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,199
is because he's managed to do things, for

32
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,219
example, like improve the

33
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,840
economic outcomes for companies like Dun

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,700
& Bradstreet, for 35 percent increases,

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,770
defining Motorola smartphone

36
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,540
strategies, it's amazing what he's done.

37
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,970
He's also done impressive things like

38
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,920
work with venture capital firms, he's

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,350
been involved in significant stake rises,

40
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,950
in various executive roles

41
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,530
for improving technological advancement

42
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,540
in the industry. So Lawrence, tell us about

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,880
you. Lawrence: Well that's

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,189
an amazing introduction. So I started as a

45
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,350
developer, second generation Internet

46
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,650
developer. Everything I learned,

47
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,470
I learned from coding and some point,

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,210
somewhere along the way, somebody said to

49
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,310
me, hey we'd like you to leave the

50
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,579
practice and then leave the business and

51
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,049
so I got to work with a lot of edge

52
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,790
technologies. I've been really fortunate

53
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,220
to do work in the early

54
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,399
Internet days, working with cards like

55
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,530
Discover card and helping them get

56
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,810
launched as you mentioned, help Motorola

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,820
with their smartphone strategy and

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,259
actually that's when I got involved with

59
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,630
crypto in the late 90s. So I've been

60
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,849
doing it since then, took a long hiatus

61
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,560
while we were figuring out how to get

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,740
the technology up and running for

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,810
that, for blockchain and then Bitcoin and

64
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,810
then worked with a lot of venture

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,370
capital. So really figuring out what's

66
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,190
the next edge technology and really,

67
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,800
really pleased to be part of RChain

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,040
and the overall efforts and working with

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,960
people like Nash. Brad: Well, I'm so glad to

70
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,070
talk to you as well, because it was

71
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,900
impressive to see the kind of scale of

72
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,910
strategic improvements you've

73
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,260
made. We're talking hundreds of millions

74
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,300
in some instances, so I found that quite

75
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,040
amazing. Nash, we move across to you,

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,360
you're clearly the

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,700
co-founder and CEO of Pyrofex. That's

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,200
impressive in itself, but you've

79
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,110
also been heavily involved in a lot of

80
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,970
other initiatives. Can you tell us about some

81
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,680
of them in your background? Nash: Sure, um first

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,900
thanks for having me on today. It's always a

83
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,810
pleasure to get a chance to talk

84
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,290
to the media.

85
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,780
I've been an engineer for

86
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,840
about 25 years, started at University

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,260
of North Carolina, working on Sunsite, where

88
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,960
we tested the Java SDK, version 1.0 and

89
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,570
I've been at Google and Oracle and a

90
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,300
number of the other, largest technology

91
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,880
firms. Mostly I work on large-scale

92
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,970
distributed systems with a special focus

93
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,230
on performance and security. Mike and I

94
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,940
started Pyrofex corporation about

95
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,920
two years ago and we're focused on

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,250
blockchain applications, platforms and

97
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,260
just improving the performance

98
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,020
and security of those. Primarily, right

99
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,240
now we're working on RChain. We think it's got

100
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,010
a lot of potential and we're really excited

101
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,360
about what's going on there.

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
Brad: I think Lawrence would agree as well,

103
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,810
Nash, on that and what's interesting

104
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,010
about you as well is that you lead a

105
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,930
team of at least 15 at the moment

106
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,640
and that's growing, so we'll talk about

107
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
that later. But guys, if we could move

108
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,210
across now to the primary subject and

109
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,030
that is obviously RChain itself. Both

110
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,190
of you are well versed in that. What

111
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,960
essentially in a nutshell is RChain,

112
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
and obviously that's a tough question

113
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,230
because it's so complex but how would

114
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,740
you explain it Lawrence? Lawrence: So RChain is

115
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,290
a third-generation blockchain platform,

116
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,140
it was really designed from the ground

117
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,988
up, based on lessons learned from Greg

118
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,000
Meredith who's the founder and the

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,120
architect of Microsoft biz talk, on how

120
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
to build highly scalable, up to 40,000

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,020
transactions per second systems and

122
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,860
it uses advanced concepts. I'll let Nash

123
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,380
dive into some of them, like composable

124
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,420
Namespaces, you can have public and

125
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,680
private blockchains.

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,020
We're developing our own, from the ground

127
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,510
up language and we'll get real deep in

128
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,670
that, called Rholang, based on mobile

129
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,780
process calculus and it allows us to do

130
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,660
advanced concepts like, correct by

131
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,720
construction programming. And those are

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,740
some of the things that are going to be

133
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,740
very differentiated and solve some

134
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,510
of the problems, like the energy suck

135
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,120
that some blockchains are creating and

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,520
some of the more unusual ones, like

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
problems with CryptoKitties.

138
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
Brad: That's an important one obviously, having

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,940
seen the disastrous impacts that had

140
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,530
on and pressure put on the blockchain.

141
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,210
Nash, can you elaborate a bit more on

142
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,800
those technical aspects as briefly,

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,880
because we're gonna address these

144
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,600
specifically as we progress through.

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,240
Nash: I think everybody knows that the

146
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,790
two main problems with those smart

147
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,140
contracting blockchains that are out

148
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,700
there, like Ethereum, are performance and

149
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,100
security. It's too easy to write

150
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,930
smart contracts that don't work the way

151
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,480
you expect, and then once you write a

152
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,400
smart contract it's really popular, they're

153
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,860
too slow, the system gets overloaded, it's

154
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,419
vulnerable to different kinds of attacks

155
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,210
and stuff like that. So, RChain has a

156
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,740
variety of different technologies that

157
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,360
are being developed in order to deal

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,110
with those. In particular, we have an

159
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,810
approach to performance that's a bit

160
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,580
more sophisticated than simply sharding

161
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,860
the network into different parts. It's

162
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,130
going to allow us to build a

163
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,500
kind of tree of different Namespaces

164
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,840
where people will be able to profitably

165
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,230
clear transactions and to run their

166
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,180
smart contracts without interference

167
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,160
from folks that they're not

168
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,250
interacting with and this will allow us

169
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,890
to run those Namespaces in parallel

170
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,620
without needing to cross transact.

171
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,050
So, my Wallet here in Provo doesn't

172
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,490
really transact with people down in

173
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,140
Australia. And so, generally

174
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,810
speaking, my Wallet doesn't care

175
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,340
about any of the transactions that

176
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,620
you're doing, where you are,

177
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,419
and so, there doesn't need to be

178
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,870
any synchronization between

179
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,430
those two programs on the blockchain. And

180
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,610
that'll really drive up the ability to

181
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,980
transact much more quickly. Then, in

182
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,350
terms of security, we've got several

183
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,880
different technologies we're baking into

184
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,850
Rholang. In particular, as Lawrence

185
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,800
mentioned, the Mobile Process Calculus or

186
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
the PI Calculus is the basis for this

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,030
programming language. It's a different way

188
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,820
of doing computing from Von Neumann

189
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,370
machines. It basically puts distributed

190
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,139
computing at the center, at the heart of

191
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,300
the programming language and then allows

192
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,000
you to build programs that are

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,310
inherently concurrent as opposed

194
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,620
to having concurrency tacked on later.

195
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,840
On top of that, we're also

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,000
going to be building into the language a

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,660
Strong Type system that allows

198
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,669
programmers to use spatial behavioral

199
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,770
types to make sure that their smart

200
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,419
contracts actually behave the way that

201
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,190
they're intended to behave so,

202
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,690
for example, you might want to be able to

203
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,000
guarantee that you don't refund money to

204
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,650
a Wallet that didn't give you money in

205
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,050
the first place. So that's

206
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,600
a fairly simple thing to express in

207
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,190
the spatial behavioral type system

208
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,810
that's gonna be at Rholang next year.

209
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,640
Brad: And Nash, you say that simple but I think

210
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,229
we can't underestimate the value of that

211
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:55,760
for users because, obviously that's a

212
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,650
huge issue right now. In that way,

213
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,660
if you do make a mistake and you do

214
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,560
happen to send it to the wrong address,

215
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
you're provided with a security measure

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,130
that's second to none in that

217
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,840
respect and giving people confidence to

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,300
trust something, like RChain's facilities.

219
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,000
If we move it back now

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,039
to one of the key aspects of

221
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,050
your design and that's your virtual

222
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,360
machine. First of all, let's

223
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
address the slogan itself. So, RChain

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,530
argues that it is the blockchain

225
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,720
solution for industrial scale utility,

226
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,990
industrial scale applications. So let's

227
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,310
talk about how you're gonna do that and

228
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,870
fundamentally you need a great virtual

229
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,150
machine to make that happen. So

230
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,549
what sets the Roh virtual machine apart,

231
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,559
why is it so good? Nash: Well, we're actually

232
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,029
working on two different virtual

233
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:43,690
machines right now. We've got the Rosette VM

234
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,209
that Greg Meredith wrote with a number of

235
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,880
excellent developers and engineers back

236
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,270
at MCC, in the late 90s. We are upgrading

237
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,920
that VM

238
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,660
to 64-bit and bringing it out. Very

239
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,310
shortly we'll be releasing a version of

240
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,100
that. That virtual machine's

241
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,320
already been tested across the world

242
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,079
in large-scale ATM networks for example,

243
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,360
and so we know that it's robust and

244
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,579
reliable for industrial processing

245
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,170
because we've simply seen it before.

246
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,149
It's done the job for many, many

247
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,670
years, it's still in use across the world,

248
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,440
and as a result of that we're very

249
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,480
confident that it's gonna work. We're

250
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
also building a new virtual machine

251
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,019
that's written in Scala and part of the

252
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,790
reason we want to build a new version of

253
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,290
the same VM is because we want to be

254
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,639
able to prove that the thing works the

255
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,470
way that we say it does, and so we're

256
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,240
using the absolute best tools we can

257
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,089
find in the space today. We're basing the

258
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,240
VM on the JVM, it's written in Scala. It's

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,550
gonna be, you know, formally verifiable,

260
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,589
formally verified at some point to

261
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,320
actually implement the virtual

262
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,699
machine that we claim that it does, and

263
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,470
we believe that that'll allow it to

264
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,260
perform and to be secure for a wide

265
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,079
variety of different applications that

266
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,610
are gonna be at scale. Brad: Awesome, and

267
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,930
Laurence if we can move across to you

268
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,240
for a moment, in the industry is a huge

269
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,100
part of the design and you're part of

270
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,390
the holdings company which is a very

271
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,519
important capital firm that, hopefully

272
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,890
you'll be definitely garnering

273
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,660
more support through various endeavors,

274
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,920
obviously through channels like this,

275
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,690
that more people have interest at

276
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,149
that level. But industry itself, why

277
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,810
industry focus? Why industry scaling, why?

278
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,970
Lawrence: It's adaptability.

279
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,550
We're looking for, I call them

280
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,760
boring use cases. Places that have lots

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,360
and lots of scale. Insurance, supply chain,

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll go into these, healthcare. Anywhere

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,890
where there's membership onboarding,

284
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,839
people want to know that that

285
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,870
information is secure and can scale. And

286
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,920
these things happen

287
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,620
millions of times every day. So the first

288
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,000
things that we're investing in, and we'll

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
announce our first formal investment in

290
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,519
probably about three weeks, our identity

291
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,279
systems. Companies that are building

292
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,230
identity solutions, why? Because they're

293
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,480
foundational to the Wallets that Nash

294
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,240
mentioned earlier, if you want to verify

295
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,160
things. And we're using advanced, or

296
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,170
they're using, I should say, advanced,

297
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,040
concepts, like zero knowledge proofs,

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,750
where you can share

299
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,529
information with only a certain amount

300
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,959
of correctness and you don't need to

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,779
expose any more than that bit of

302
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,940
information. Brad: I see, so essentially you're

303
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,170
talking about trusting the blockchain

304
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,519
as well as having applications

305
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,800
built-in for people to verify their ID

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,100
and have it certified through

307
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,920
the partnerships you're making? Lawrence: Verified?

308
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,050
Yes, verified and then shared, so there's

309
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,449
many different companies that are

310
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,240
working on this and we partner with a

311
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,589
number, Trusted Key, Life ID, Evernym,

312
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,899
a lot of that work. We're also creating

313
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,870
working groups for the larger community so

314
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,850
it's not just our investment.

315
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,660
we're doing that in identity, in storage,

316
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,699
in supply chain, those are the first

317
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:58,009
three that we're really working heavily

318
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,230
on. Brad: And, obviously you say the

319
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,389
first three but those are huge in itself,

320
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,490
so, no doubt, the partners we're talking

321
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,889
about here are all of significant size, much

322
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:08,540
like your own credentials

323
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,430
and the things that you've done. Let's

324
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,050
move across now to sharding, Nash. I want

325
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,699
to talk to you about that. The

326
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,350
partitioning aspect of RChain's, really

327
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,730
quite exceptional, can you tell us a bit

328
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,569
about how it works? Nash: Well, there are

329
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,829
substantial portions of it that are

330
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:23,779
still being finalized but at the end of

331
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,350
the day, the goal is to allow different

332
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,260
smart contracts to run in parallel,

333
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,120
truly concurrently. So they're

334
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,279
running in parallel with no interaction

335
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,420
if they don't need to. And we use

336
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,519
a feature of the PI Calculus called

337
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,980
scope extrusion to determine when a

338
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,620
smart contract needs to be elevated into

339
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,389
a larger Namespace, so that it can

340
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,550
interact with other smart contracts and

341
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,769
then, once it's done performing those

342
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,209
interactions we can perform scope

343
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,010
retraction to bring it back down into a

344
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,990
smaller Namespace, that allows it to run

345
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,329
much more cheaply. And the goal in this

346
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,730
case is basically to ensure that there

347
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,319
are places in the blockchain where lots

348
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,029
of transactions can be happening where

349
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,769
there's lots of interactions, but also

350
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,449
where you could have things that are

351
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,639
much more isolated, and to allow that to

352
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,649
be done, basically by the users

353
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,509
themselves. So we want to create a

354
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,160
system where the users get to control the

355
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,980
structure, and the users get to determine

356
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,459
how

357
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,290
they want to deploy their contracts and

358
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,879
where they would like to pay their fees

359
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,339
for validation or mining and that type

360
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:31,970
of thing.

361
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,379
Brad: It's great that you are

362
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,420
providing that degree of concurrency and

363
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,740
if we could talk about some of those

364
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,300
functions relations that Nash (mentioned) while

365
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,769
we're on that topic of meta programming,

366
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,959
for example, or the reactive data streams

367
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,610
and the pattern matching, those

368
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,129
aspects are really key to this. So can

369
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,019
you just briefly touch on

370
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:54,800
those? Nash: Yeah, at the end

371
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,980
of the day, there's a

372
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,720
decentralized consensus system in

373
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,759
basically every computing platform.

374
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,230
Most people don't realize it but

375
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,360
there's a consensus system inside your

376
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,089
Intel CPU. There are instructions that

377
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,670
implement memory gates to cause main

378
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,619
RAM to synchronize with the CPU cache

379
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,709
and that's how two cores inside your CPU

380
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,209
actually interact with each other. So

381
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,399
when you want to create high-performance

382
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,519
flows, you have to have

383
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,819
minimum synchronization. You want to be

384
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:26,899
able to run all the data through a

385
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,059
single core,

386
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:30,259
without having to interact with the

387
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,179
other core, because otherwise it'll

388
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,220
be constantly interrupted and

389
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,350
spending all its time gating memory and

390
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,209
doing all of this synchronization work,

391
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,249
which is expensive. The blockchain works

392
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,929
exactly the same way. If we want to

393
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:43,790
create high performance data flows on

394
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,319
the blockchain, between

395
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,999
two different locations in the

396
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,769
world, the trick is going to be, to make

397
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,179
sure that they interact with each other

398
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,240
and a minimum of other people. Today on Ethereum

399
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,399
if you want to publish a

400
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,399
transaction, it's

401
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,350
in lockstep with every single other

402
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,269
transaction all across the entire globe.

403
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,790
RChain totally breaks that

404
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,649
model. We don't need to order

405
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,860
transactions relative to

406
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,629
each other unless the transactions are

407
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:14,269
actually related. Brad: I think that's a

408
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,279
massive point because again, to use an

409
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,720
analogy, if you're thinking about it like

410
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,819
a line of people, there's no distinction

411
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,679
between them, they can be

412
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,179
positioned anywhere in that line for the

413
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,499
Ethereum. And what you're doing is

414
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,819
breaking apart that line and you're

415
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,240
creating different, in parallel, sync

416
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
components that are going to facilitate

417
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,050
computational advancement and also

418
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,420
scalability itself. Lawrence, if we can

419
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,220
talk about something you're

420
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,290
experienced in, and that's enterprise.

421
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,580
We're so fortunate to have

422
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,290
Nash leading the way with all the

423
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,000
technological and technical

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,100
aspects of RChain, but you're certainly

425
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,890
privy to none of the deals you're

426
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,050
making. And in the future, how important is

427
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,630
the vision in enterprise for RChain

428
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,209
Holdings? Lawrence: It's huge.

429
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,690
I mean it is part of our sort of

430
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,630
midterm goals in a couple of ways,

431
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,579
because as Nash has pointed out, this is

432
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,350
a very different programming paradigm,

433
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,310
and what it allows you to do, is be more

434
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,430
robust with your transactions, provide

435
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,130
more scalability and change the way that

436
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,230
they're doing (business?)

437
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,700
At the end of the day,

438
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,490
it's very simple, it's a cost play. By

439
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,170
being able to put things on the

440
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,890
blockchain, like membership onboarding. And I'd

441
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,630
love to talk about aspirational things,

442
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,279
don't get me wrong, but these are things

443
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,440
that we could do in six months, once

444
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,690
we're fully live,

445
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,550
taking costs out of membership

446
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,339
onboarding, property title transfers, all

447
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,649
the enterprise. I spoke to the insurance

448
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,709
industry here in the US last month.

449
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,200
They're very excited about the

450
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,690
opportunities with blockchain and how

451
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,520
RChain can help them scale and

452
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,470
streamline what they're doing. In the

453
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,079
medical industry, in constructing

454
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:01,220
documents for the legal industry, in the

455
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,950
music industry, not for streaming but for

456
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,150
things like venues and other aspects

457
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,400
that artists need, because today

458
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,109
artists are making very little off their

459
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:15,290
music. It's the sale, it's about the

460
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,329
venues and the merch and we can put

461
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,520
those on the blockchain.

462
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,339
And they've learned that they get

463
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,750
disrupted. In 2008-2009, US banking system,

464
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,640
the banking system around the world had

465
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,460
some stumbling blocks.

466
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,640
They lost trust and then they

467
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,440
discovered blockchain and they got

468
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,470
behind it in a big way. Brad: And you said

469
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,059
that also Lawrence, because many people

470
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,220
don't know how early they adopted it but

471
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,450
if you go and do the research they

472
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,040
absorbed it, many banks. And we're

473
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,370
talking about some of the

474
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,470
largest in the world. And we won't name

475
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,779
names, but one CEO in

476
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,760
particular has been quite vocal, let's

477
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,950
say, but underneath that, he has certainly

478
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,110
been adopting it.

479
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,580
So it is a really serious thing that

480
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,640
you make, is what you're saying. Lawrence: His picture

481
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,789
is the first slide that I've used in

482
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,620
every deck for the last six months and

483
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,380
if you go to my LinkedIn, you'll see it's there, but

484
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,360
yeah. Brad: I'm sure it's worth

485
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,850
diamonds, not gold, let's say. So in that

486
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,049
respect, I wanted to ask you

487
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:19,279
specifically, what I really like about

488
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,840
the way you're addressing this is that

489
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,039
you're not just focused on

490
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,049
enterprise, that is a huge component but

491
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,159
with Nash to support, you're also

492
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,140
considering the user, the late user in

493
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,760
the space because there are provisions

494
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,470
for them and that's what makes blockchain

495
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,000
so exciting in this respect, is

496
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,610
that it has this mutually

497
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,409
beneficial environment between these two

498
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:38,890
parties. Do you think that's fair to say?

499
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,840
Lawrence: Yes, and it happens in many different

500
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,240
ways. And the thing that's key about

501
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,970
RChain, and that I say whenever I look at

502
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,529
any blockchain, whatever it is and I

503
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,240
write about it almost every day, is that

504
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,370
there is an earn-able token.

505
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,260
There is something that's transact-able,

506
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,179
that you can put your finger on, and say,

507
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,480
ah-ha, here's why people are going to

508
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,919
come in. So, anyone could be a

509
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,570
miner. There are gonna be lots of

510
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,360
different opportunities for that, to do

511
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,850
the proofing algorithm and I know Nash

512
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,880
is gonna go deep on Casper, but that

513
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,970
is a key point that we bring out,

514
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,950
that you can look at, dare I say,

515
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,289
the legitimacy of the RChain platform.

516
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,720
Brad: I agree, and obviously that's the reason

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,799
why we're talking, because I was reading

518
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,659
into your work and quite amazed by

519
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,820
two things. Firstly, the complexity, that's

520
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,350
why we have Nash here to explain those

521
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,020
things, but also I suppose, the lack

522
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,210
of attention you've had so far.

523
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,380
You're flying under the radar in a

524
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,390
massive way and I wonder why, because of

525
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,549
what you already, clearly are planning on

526
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,549
doing and the tech behind it and the team.

527
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:42,559
Again, no question in that comment, but it

528
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,210
does surprise me that that is happening.

529
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,860
Let's move across now to the smart

530
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,570
contracts, that is one of the really

531
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,700
impressive things about RChain. In

532
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,990
that you are claiming that you are

533
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,029
dynamic, you're responsive, you're provably

534
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,490
correct as smart contract operations. And so

535
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,460
can you talk Nash about

536
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,210
what really sets the RChain smart

537
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,270
contract apart? Nash: Yeah, it's

538
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,750
fascinating really. For the

539
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,660
vast majority of our industry's history

540
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,430
we've worked with a single model of

541
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,350
computing, called the Von Neumann machine.

542
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,060
There are some minor variations

543
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,710
that are out there, Java Stack Machine

544
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,940
and some other things. But at the end of

545
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,910
the day, your most computing platforms are

546
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,690
built on top of Von Neumann machines.

547
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,610
RChain's built on top of the PI Calculus,

548
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,950
it was a model of computation, it

549
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,350
was invented about 25 years ago by a guy

550
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,750
named Milner. It was designed to help him

551
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,330
analyze distributed systems because

552
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,300
there was no real theoretical tools in

553
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,160
the Von Neumann architecture to help you

554
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,310
do that. And for the next two and a

555
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,410
half decades people continued to bang

556
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,150
their head against Von Neumann machines'

557
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,000
lack of facility with distributed

558
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,710
systems.

559
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,420
I've built built systems that

560
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,150
run on tens of thousands of computers for

561
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,950
Google, 50 different data centers at the

562
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,200
same time. I've seen what we do,

563
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,780
the lengths that we go to, to build systems

564
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,820
that are scalable and fast and reliable,

565
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,970
And it's incredible. And a lot of these

566
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,580
tools are just native to the PI

567
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,010
calculus. And so, at the end of the day,

568
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,050
what we're really excited to do, is to

569
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,700
introduce a programming model to people

570
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,260
through our smart contracts, that's going

571
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,120
to allow them to write applications that

572
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,890
are inherently large-scale, inherently

573
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,080
concurrent and paralyzable from the

574
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,660
ground up. And I think,

575
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,860
it's gonna be really fascinating and

576
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,160
interesting but also allows for a wide

577
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,470
variety of additional security and

578
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,330
reliability features to be layered into

579
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,630
the toolset. So, we're very excited about that.

580
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,400
Brad: Likewise, and that's music to my ears, it

581
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,690
sounds amazing. Let's talk about

582
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,640
Namespace, because you were referring to

583
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,350
that before, that's really important to

584
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,450
the overall visibility aspects of both

585
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,100
the smart contacts and the blockchain

586
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,010
design. What is Namespace? Why is it

587
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,510
important? Nash: So, Namespaces. If you want to

588
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,890
think of something to give you a sense

589
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,000
of how it's going to work, they're gonna

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,310
look a lot like URLs. So you

591
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,840
could have the domain and then you could

592
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,490
have sub-paths underneath that domain,

593
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,680
that describe different resources within

594
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,910
your system.

595
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,680
Namespaces are gonna be the mechanism by

596
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,280
which the blockchain is sharded into a

597
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,890
hierarchical tree of different domains

598
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,440
of consideration and then transactions

599
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,810
are actually validated within an

600
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,760
individual Namespace rather than across

601
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,100
a global Namespace, the

602
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,070
way the Ethereum is. Because they look

603
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,920
like URLs, you get a lot of theoretical

604
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,010
and practical utility that comes along

605
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,020
with all our 40 years of experience with

606
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,880
the UNIX file system and all of

607
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,610
our understanding about how that works.

608
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,620
Many, many of those principles just go

609
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,870
right through, under RChain and

610
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,430
they're gonna allow us to scale

611
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,120
incredibly quickly and to keep the fees

612
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,960
and the economic incentives from

613
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,140
becoming plutocratic.

614
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,640
Brad: Let's move across now because

615
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,810
that's really impressive. I don't wanna

616
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,190
spend the whole time just on tech but

617
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,810
I'm sure Nash, you could talk for hours on

618
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,030
that, but if we move across now to

619
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,590
the relevance, that in the real world, in

620
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,240
terms of scalability, everything has to

621
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,160
have the purpose of application. So

622
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Lawrence, in the real world, we're talking

623
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,630
of just how important is the

624
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,480
scalability of RChain.

625
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,980
We're talking

626
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,660
about the enterprise. What time frames

627
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,950
are we looking at for the application,

628
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,660
for the scalability to be usable

629
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,060
in context. Lawrence:

630
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,300
Later in the year, end of the year, we'll

631
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,370
have the full Mercury release and

632
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,400
then we'll start seeing the applications

633
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,050
come out shortly after that. But we're

634
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,750
already having the conversations on

635
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,450
supply chain. I've spoken to two of

636
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,210
the card brands already, the credit card

637
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,040
companies who are looking at this

638
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,940
technology to get into the micro payment

639
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,400
space. So we tried that back in the 90s,

640
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,930
it failed because we didn't have the

641
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,150
tech or the infrastructure. But they want

642
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,910
to do their own applications that are

643
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,020
going to be able to do it and they want

644
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,940
to be able to do it at extremely high

645
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,860
speeds. I've talked to companies that

646
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,450
want to put out loyalty programs. We've

647
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,390
talked about identity. It's key for them

648
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,030
to be able to do this quickly but also

649
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,970
be able to leverage things like

650
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,620
Namespaces, to keep things private when,

651
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,940
partly because of the speed reasons. But

652
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,500
not everybody needs to see the

653
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,830
deals you're doing or your supply chain,

654
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,510
but because things move along so quickly

655
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,850
in the supply chain and you can analyze

656
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,650
them when there's a problem.

657
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,110
Walmart is an existing and famous case

658
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,140
study for doing pork products in that,

659
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,720
I've talked to three other CIOs who want

660
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,120
to do exactly the same thing but they're

661
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,430
concerned about bumping their heads on

662
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,010
the ceiling of existing blockchains.

663
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,320
Brad: And also for questions about that,

664
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,090
just off the top of my head, is

665
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,800
that when we talk about these

666
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,140
companies like Walmart, we talk about...

667
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,120
Obviously I'm in China quite a lot

668
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,470
looking at exploring blockchains there,

669
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,270
many of them are permissioned. Many of

670
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,860
them are really centralized as well

671
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,960
in their structure. You guys

672
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,060
are also doing this in a public space. Is

673
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,380
that fair to say? You're looking at it as

674
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,710
an operational public blockchain. Lawrence: Yeah!

675
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,640
So that's also another thing that's

676
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,050
setting you apart, with this R&D

677
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,970
and rolling it out in this respect, is

678
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,520
that you are essentially Open Source by

679
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,070
design. Is that also correct? Lawrence: Yeah. I look at it like this. We

680
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,600
want our children to be more successful

681
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,750
than us. Brad: That's really fascinating.

682
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,880
So let's talk about the impact, I suppose,

683
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,190
of smart contracts in terms of the

684
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,970
DApps, that's important. How will

685
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,010
RChain essentially impact

686
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,470
upon the overall space of DApps? Nash: Yeah,

687
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,240
that's a really good question. So I think

688
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,930
that one of the biggest problems that

689
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,820
we've had with DApps to adapt deployment

690
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,010
so far, is that they can essentially only

691
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,870
do what the blockchain already does

692
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,870
reasonably well. We have some

693
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,890
distributed exchanges where you can

694
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,980
perform transaction clearing in a book,

695
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,530
and maybe the Maker DAO's Dai stuff

696
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,630
is a good example of a DApp that

697
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,090
works pretty well. But these are not

698
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,110
applications that really stretch the

699
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,780
blockchain use case from the basic

700
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,480
ledger system to something radical

701
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,070
and new. And the reason is simply

702
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,200
performance and reliability. Nobody's

703
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,970
going to put their West Texas

704
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,190
Intermediate crude options market on to

705
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,960
Ethereum, the way that it stands today.

706
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,210
It's just not secure enough and it's not

707
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,410
fast enough and

708
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,320
it's not reliable enough. And so we

709
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,090
have to fix those problems before we're

710
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,380
going to be able to build DApps that

711
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,360
really matter. And as soon as we do I think

712
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,100
we're gonna see a rich blossoming of a

713
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,170
variety of different ideas that are both

714
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,390
industrial, that are financial, that are

715
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,720
artistic, that are community oriented.

716
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,160
There's a lot of different variety here

717
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,840
because there's just an incredible

718
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,140
amount of interaction between people in

719
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,150
public spaces that the blockchain can

720
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,340
help to mediate and that smart contracts

721
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,890
can actually facilitate. Brad: I agree, and also

722
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,450
if we talk about Namespace, Lawrence, as

723
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,680
well as the importance of the ideal

724
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,840
component. Do you envisage that also

725
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,000
they'll be transitioning from Ethereum,

726
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
once you're established and up and

727
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,720
running as a mainnet and as a viable entity

728
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,580
on the blockchain for people to access.

729
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,950
It sounds like it

730
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,660
would be common sense to switch over in

731
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,040
many instances for the

732
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,440
reasons we've been talking about. Lawrence:
Well, we

733
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,240
know that people will always use

734
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,460
multiple ones and they, people tend to

735
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,930
stick to things that they're familiar

736
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,540
with, they say no to complicated things.

737
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,130
So, what we're doing is focusing on

738
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,230
education. We put out a lot of

739
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,480
information and we're looking for,

740
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,310
obviously Ethereum developers because

741
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,680
they know the blockchain space, they

742
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,530
understand it and so we're looking

743
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,350
to build content, partnerships to build

744
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,510
content and partnerships with

745
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,680
companies that do software development,

746
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,310
like what

747
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,190
Pyrofex is doing. I do want to say one

748
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,930
thing about the previous question about

749
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,230
DApps, it's kind of a really important

750
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,130
point in the industry. Because of the way

751
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,870
we're building them, the energy

752
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,550
consumption for RChain is going to be

753
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,510
significantly less than what you're

754
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,610
seeing today. And from a social

755
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,310
environmental impact standpoint that's a

756
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,380
big deal and I know there's been a lot

757
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,450
of people like yourself who've spoken

758
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,340
about it, so I did want to bring that out.

759
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,840
Brad: I think it's crucially important also,

760
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,550
not only for that reason, but for the

761
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,110
competitive market of blockchain right

762
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,130
now because there are several,

763
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,840
particularly in China, who are also

764
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,600
competing at that level. And again, we

765
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,150
can't sort of undervalue that

766
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,070
position that you're taking because

767
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,260
blockchain is moving at such a rapid rate

768
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,600
that you look for a moment, you

769
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,130
look back a month ago and you suddenly

770
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,330
see how far

771
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,070
things have changed, literally,

772
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,350
just in this conversation of scalability.

773
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,200
So it's quite fascinating

774
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,900
that you are very much on

775
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,580
the ball with that. It's not

776
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,530
just fascinating, it's important. If we can

777
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,450
move across now to the DAG itself,

778
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,550
obviously that's a huge component

779
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,190
of many really robust blockchains, but is

780
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,100
the RChain just a DAG? Like Hashgraph

781
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
for example, or is it similar?

782
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,520
How does it work?

783
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,700
Nash: RChain is not simply a DAG. Obviously any

784
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,430
graph of transactions is gonna have

785
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,680
a DAG component, in the sense

786
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,480
that that's a

787
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,340
very common data structure, but

788
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,400
RChain is not just limited

789
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,210
to the DAG operations that Hashgraph

790
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,940
is. It's a true blockchain and so

791
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,250
when you validate inside of a particular

792
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,710
Namespace, you're gonna be synchronizing

793
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,880
with other people who are running inside

794
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,040
that Namespace but you're gonna be doing

795
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,560
it independently of other Namespaces

796
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,910
that you're not currently interacting

797
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,120
with. And that allows Casper to run

798
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,880
much more rapidly and to validate

799
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,980
transactions at a much higher speed than

800
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,110
you would get if you have to

801
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,420
continuously be syncing up along the way.

802
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,640
Brad: Right, and let's talk about data

803
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,380
separation as well, because that's also

804
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,610
something that's outlined on your

805
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,280
website. How important is that

806
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,910
aspect of the design? Nash: I think that at the

807
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,180
end of the day, the reality is that

808
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,950
blockchains are going to be responsible

809
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,720
for a lot of data. And we're already

810
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,580
starting to see what happens when you

811
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,710
put too much data on a centralized

812
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,960
blockchain like Ethereum, that the

813
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,490
machines become, the nodes themselves

814
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,100
become incredibly expensive to

815
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,260
purchase from just a storage perspective,

816
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,390
At this point, what would it

817
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,130
cost somebody to build a node that could

818
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,560
even catch up. So, you have to

819
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,600
BitTorrent down the latest snapshot

820
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
and go through all these steps in order

821
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,110
to be able to sync your Ethereum node

822
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,670
and just get on the network and start

823
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,280
validating. And the reality is that we're

824
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,570
gonna have to have a solution for that.

825
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,060
So, data storage is a fundamental part of

826
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,950
RChain, you've actually got a very

827
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,419
interesting data storage layer that

828
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:11,169
we're going to be releasing

829
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,840
independently later this year. It's based

830
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,700
on the Lightning database which is being

831
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,850
used across a lot of applications. It's

832
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,519
gonna include a predicate query language

833
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,470
that's completely unique I think, at this

834
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,240
point in the database space. And we're

835
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,610
gonna use that layer in order to provide

836
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,700
high speed, high throughput storage and

837
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,399
I/O for every single node

838
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,559
that ships, that's on the RChain network.

839
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,179
And then of course those will be

840
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,980
sharded by Namespace, so the data

841
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,169
that gets stored in your smart contract

842
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:42,669
is gonna be stored in the Namespace

843
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:44,769
where it's most affordable to provide

844
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,070
storage. And so there will be Namespaces

845
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,480
where people build systems that are

846
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,639
extremely good at, like long term storage

847
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,620
and they don't charge very much for

848
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,049
archival data storage and you can run a

849
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,940
smart contract there with giant datasets

850
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,159
that's at excellent and

851
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,720
reliable backup because that's what they

852
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,880
designed the Namespace to do. Then right

853
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,899
next door there will be another

854
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:06,909
Namespace where most of the guys have

855
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:09,159
figured out, hey we're gonna put SSDs in

856
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,230
all our nodes, we're gonna make the

857
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,760
storage expensive but we're gonna make it

858
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,679
really fast. So if you want to run a high

859
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,350
throughput job on a small data set,

860
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,669
it's gonna be very affordable and

861
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,440
efficient to do it right over here and

862
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,460
this is where you want to make that

863
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,620
deployment, and so essentially... Brad: Sorry,

864
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,120
and that's exactly where Lawrence fits in,

865
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,260
with all of his experiences

866
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,639
because you'll be selling that

867
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,010
fact to many companies around the world,

868
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,720
that the efficiency is there and the

869
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,470
economy is there. Lawrence: And we've already had

870
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,289
conversations with some of the projects

871
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,940
that are building out blockchain

872
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,100
oriented storage. They are hungry for

873
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,590
this information and they're asking us

874
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,600
to provide. Well here's what I'm hearing

875
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,850
about supply, all of that rich supply

876
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,039
chain data, especially in food safety, that

877
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,779
seems to me the number one use case

878
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:55,389
that people are asking and they want to

879
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,889
be able to put that information there.

880
00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:00,250
Healthcare records and parts of the

881
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,779
healthcare, I think transformation of

882
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,240
that will take some time but people want

883
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,250
that information on the blockchain.

884
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,919
There's great use cases, France has an

885
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,649
existing model that uses older

886
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:14,200
technology on chip cards but it's very

887
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,230
applicable to this, and that's why

888
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,179
storage is our second working group.

889
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:21,190
So, we want to create the

890
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,630
industry conversation.

891
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,030
We certainly want to help lead it, but we

892
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,150
were inviting others to actually run the

893
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,220
working group channels. Brad: Yeah, that sounds really

894
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,809
interesting, if we can move across now,

895
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,760
Nash, to Casper itself because Laurence

896
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,650
was mentioning that previously with

897
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,750
hoping it could lead to that. No doubt

898
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,250
you're planning on implementing that at

899
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,679
some stage in its most robust form, so

900
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,960
what's happening with Casper, as part

901
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,809
of the rollout? Nash: Yeah, it's very exciting

902
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,720
right now. We recently acquired a

903
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,510
developer in Toronto, who's leading

904
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,909
Pyrofex's efforts to take Vlad and

905
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,950
Greg's work from the Casper working

906
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,210
group, to actually build out the

907
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,630
implementation. He's doing a great job, he

908
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,630
just dropped, most recently, a fairly

909
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,130
interesting article on medium, maybe you

910
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,450
could put it in the show notes.

911
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,239
Yeah, Michael Birch is an

912
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,639
incredible guy, he's doing a great work.

913
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,590
Vlad has produced a simulator that we

914
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,320
can use at the moment, to simulate the

915
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,270
operation of Casper, and so we're going

916
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,149
through that implementation and figuring

917
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:27,310
out exactly what details we want to

918
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,020
twiddle here and there.

919
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,480
Casper, it turns out is a family of

920
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,889
different algorithms that can be

921
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,570
implemented in different ways, and you

922
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,460
get to choose different parameter sets

923
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,290
depending upon exactly how you want your

924
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,080
consensus system to operate. And so, as we

925
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,480
integrate the work on Namespaces with

926
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,060
Vlad's work on Casper, we're very

927
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,820
close to beginning a full-scale rollout.

928
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,918
We should have it integrated with the

929
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,310
node later this summer and ready for

930
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,560
testing when we fire up the testnet in

931
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,020
the fall. Brad: Right, and obviously Vlad is a

932
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,080
famous member of

933
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,150
the blockchain community. Let's just get

934
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,470
real with this, I mean his credentials

935
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,060
are quite outstanding in their own right.

936
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,980
How important and fundamental is it to

937
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,869
have Vlad on your board of directors? Lawrence: I

938
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:16,480
mean, Vlad is doing two things with us,

939
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,140
one, Casper and he's in there with

940
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,840
the developers. We had a week-long

941
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,080
retreat that was in Pyrofex's home

942
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,810
town or home state, and we spent a week

943
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,480
working on that. I should say

944
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,260
they, I haven't

945
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,900
done that kind of computing in a while,

946
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,820
and Vlad is also working with us

947
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,920
on governance. How do you govern a

948
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,590
blockchain, it's hugely complicated and

949
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,240
we're working out those issues.

950
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,630
In mid-February, a large number of the

951
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,150
members of the RChain coop and other

952
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,750
interested parties are coming to Seattle

953
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,060
to work on that. And so, he's really

954
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,960
giving us some real leadership of the

955
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,900
the dynamics of running a blockchain for

956
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,670
now and the next three years.

957
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,710
Brad: That's exciting, I mean that was one of

958
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,690
the things, I have to say looking,

959
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,850
researching, Vlad led me to RChain, so

960
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,440
I think it's a huge, hugely

961
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,660
important component. If we can talk about

962
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,250
comparisons guys, I know we've brief

963
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,510
touched on it, but let's talk about in

964
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,950
more general sense of blockchains, not

965
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,920
just Ethereum. What are the key,

966
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,930
real, the driving components or the

967
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,369
driving features that really, genuinely

968
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:26,530
set you apart from all the main chain

969
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,580
blockchains? I'm not talking about all

970
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,109
these projects that come forth as Dapps,

971
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:31,210
but there are some serious blockchains

972
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,859
we're not talking about as well.

973
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,960
I represent one who is very well-known

974
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,690
in China. But let's get real, for the

975
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,330
future of RChain, what really does set

976
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:45,880
you apart? Fundamentally, is it the smart

977
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,670
contracts' design? Nash: I think

978
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,160
that at the end of the

979
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,020
day, the thing that's most unique about

980
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,540
RChain is that we've been able to

981
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,910
gather a development team, it's about 20

982
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,400
people strong. It's got, I think we're up

983
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,700
to 7 PhDs in mathematics. We've got four

984
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,810
ex-Googlers. The number of guys on

985
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,100
our team with more than 20 years of

986
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,950
industry experience is outstanding.

987
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,750
When I look at a

988
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,340
project or when I look at a company or

989
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,250
when I look at a technology, the first

990
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,830
question that I always ask as an

991
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,720
investor or as an interested party is,

992
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,240
what's the team. Because if you

993
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,190
talk to VCs in Silicon Valley they want

994
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,750
to invest in teams. They know

995
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,900
that regardless of what the technology

996
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,520
idea is today, things are going to change,

997
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,990
they're gonna have to pivot and make

998
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,150
adjustments in order to ensure they can

999
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,500
deliver something to the market that's

1000
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,000
going to work. And I think that

1001
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,640
RChain's team is just incredible. We

1002
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,260
recently, I think yesterday we hit a

1003
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,870
thousand people in our Telegram channel.

1004
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,730
We have a community that's

1005
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,920
incredibly committed and incredibly

1006
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,350
dedicated to working on the technology,

1007
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,940
providing all the support and

1008
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,010
infrastructure and the core Dev team is

1009
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,650
just unbelievably strong. From Vlad and

1010
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,980
Greg Meredith, to Mike Stay, to Kyle Butt from

1011
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,810
Google's compiler team we've just got a

1012
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,480
ton of guys with just incredible resumes.

1013
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,430
Brad: And also Nash, if people want to

1014
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,690
know more about them you can certainly

1015
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,070
go to your website there's several links,

1016
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,080
I've had a look at all of them. I think,

1017
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,750
with respect to also the overall

1018
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,760
performance of RChain in the market

1019
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,470
it's also been substantial

1020
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,540
in recent days. So that's exciting also

1021
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,040
that there's uptake and there's interest

1022
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,470
in the community space of blockchain

1023
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,050
and cryptocurrency. If we can now move

1024
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,370
across a bit more and talk on the

1025
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,950
partners, as you said Nash, I totally agree

1026
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,880
when you look at a white paper you

1027
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,310
scroll very quickly to partners. You want

1028
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,530
to see that it's backed by

1029
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,960
serious support. Lawrence, you can answer

1030
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,060
this as well, I'm sure. Key partners right

1031
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,920
now are RChain Holding, that represents

1032
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,020
you, also Nash with you at Pyrofex.

1033
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,030
But let's expand and extrapolate this

1034
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,910
further. Just how extensive are the

1035
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,170
partnerships, we don't know. Lawrence: I always like

1036
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,270
to talk about things that are

1037
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:01,320
done and complete like, we

1038
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,510
deliver code. We're having very broad

1039
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,700
conversations with universities because

1040
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,150
education is important to us. Exchanges,

1041
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,980
not because we want the token there,

1042
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,750
we're happy to have it, we appreciate it.

1043
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,630
But how do we help them scale? How do

1044
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,600
they build the next generation? Storage.

1045
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,470
Storage, storage, storage, identity

1046
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,150
solutions, we're talking to all of the

1047
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,820
major identity vendors and we'll be

1048
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,500
taking partnerships there. Brad: Bottom line, is

1049
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,520
massive. I can see you're thinking

1050
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,310
through a long list. I wish I

1051
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,600
was inside your brain right now and

1052
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,920
knowing those names, but we'll find them

1053
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,150
I'm sure later on when you're willing to

1054
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,190
tell us. Let's talk about the nine

1055
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,310
board members themselves, specifically,

1056
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,230
how important is it having a

1057
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,420
diversified board like this? Lawrence: You get

1058
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,430
a range of opinions and a range

1059
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,579
of experiences, that aren't just the

1060
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,130
technical which we absolutely need. But

1061
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,869
we're also a multinational

1062
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,299
board. Which you don't see very often.

1063
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,640
I've been on public and private boards.

1064
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,039
What we're getting is experience from

1065
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,890
people in Europe who understand what

1066
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,390
does it mean to build things there, and

1067
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,969
from that developer perspective, from the

1068
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,339
enterprise perspective, from a cultural

1069
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,969
perspective, those things add to the

1070
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:28,619
richness of governance of the coop and

1071
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,809
the way that we're building. And Nash,

1072
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,369
you've probably got your own perspective on

1073
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,890
that as well.

1074
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,079
Brad: What are

1075
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,369
you thinking Nash in terms of that as

1076
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,809
well? Particularly from the technical

1077
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,029
standpoint, because as, a rich,

1078
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,440
the grave experience just in the

1079
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,339
technical side. Nash: Yeah, both

1080
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,749
on the governance side and on the

1081
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:50,839
technical side I think it's really

1082
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,119
impressive the way that the blockchain

1083
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,349
industry in general has been able to

1084
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:57,299
pull people in from all across the world.

1085
00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:00,329
We've got our

1086
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,309
16th developer on the RChain project

1087
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:06,479
just today. And we have about a third

1088
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:08,940
outside the United States.

1089
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,099
So we've got guys all the way from

1090
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,769
Russia, to Germany, to Poland,

1091
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:17,999
just all across the world. And it's

1092
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,799
really impressive to be able to pull in

1093
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:22,289
perspectives from all over. You can

1094
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:25,499
get guys reviewing each other's code in

1095
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,579
the middle of the night so that

1096
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,499
when the developer wakes back up

1097
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,789
somebody's already checked out what he's

1098
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:31,410
done the previous day. You could go right

1099
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,269
back to work and it's really

1100
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:35,430
incredible how fast things move

1101
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,799
and how many different perspectives we

1102
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,749
have, that help us maintain a

1103
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,279
holistic vision. Brad: Awesome, and just in

1104
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:45,869
terms of community support, obviously

1105
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,479
there's a huge aspect of market

1106
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,699
sentiment, the whole nature of

1107
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:52,289
blockchain is hinging on

1108
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:54,719
community itself, that I

1109
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,459
suppose is socially imperative. So how are

1110
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:58,289
you catering for the small

1111
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:00,869
guy, to people like me, who want

1112
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,130
to know more about RChain. Who want to access

1113
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:04,559
perhaps a stake in this

1114
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,019
incredible technology. How are you

1115
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:08,670
supporting these kind of people with

1116
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,589
reward systems or with being

1117
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:11,880
able to even access it through social

1118
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,819
media streams?

1119
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:17,609
Nash: Yeah, that's a really good question.

1120
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:19,589
RChain, the development team and the

1121
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:21,839
community in general have a really rich

1122
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,119
bounty system that we've built, that

1123
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,819
allows individual open source developers

1124
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,979
to make contributions whether it's on

1125
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,289
the marketing side, whether it's on the

1126
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:33,119
web development side, whether it's

1127
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,529
writing technical documentation,

1128
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:37,380
contributing code. One of our most active

1129
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,269
developers over the last few weeks has

1130
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:40,920
turned out to be a bounty developer,

1131
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,589
he’s come into the project, he's earning

1132
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,799
RHOCs as a member of the community, he's

1133
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,190
contributing to improvement of the software. Brad: And

1134
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,239
that's why we love blockchain, because

1135
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,529
it opens up

1136
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,329
possibilities for people. If we move

1137
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,400
across now, just to the late consumer in

1138
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,319
that, someone who just wants to know how

1139
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,269
to take part in them. Let's talk about

1140
00:43:00,269 --> 00:43:02,339
roadmaps, let's talk about times when

1141
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,619
people can actually take part

1142
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,410
actively in RChain. When is all

1143
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,190
that gonna unfold? Lawrence: There's a number of

1144
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,229
different streams. Come to

1145
00:43:13,229 --> 00:43:14,880
rchain.coop (website),

1146
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,099
join some of the hangouts, they're

1147
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,700
mostly public for community work. We have

1148
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,680
a thriving discord channel, we'll give

1149
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,259
you all the links. We've got over 700

1150
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:28,349
developers on our QQ channel in China,

1151
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:30,839
we're doing active meetups around the

1152
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:33,089
world. I'm gonna be in San Francisco next

1153
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:35,910
week, we've got 50 people signed up for

1154
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,150
our first meetup there, we're at the

1155
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,460
runway. And this is in the Twitter

1156
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,519
building, so that we can continue to push

1157
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,009
those out and because it's such an open

1158
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,839
community, almost every one of these

1159
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,329
hangouts is broadcast on YouTube. Brad: Right,

1160
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,890
and you're already live on exchanges,

1161
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,999
that's correct, isn't it? Lawrence: It's correct.

1162
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:58,109
Brad: So sorry, can you say that again Lawrence?

1163
00:43:58,109 --> 00:43:59,910
Just so we're really crystal clear.

1164
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,789
Lawrence: We're in KuCoin and EtherDelta.

1165
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:04,680
Brad: So you're on very few exchanges which

1166
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,319
translates to, a huge future in

1167
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,890
terms of exchange access. For those

1168
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,900
people who may not know

1169
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,299
much about EtherDelta, obviously

1170
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:16,640
KuCoin is quite a user friendly platform.

1171
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,960
Let's talk about the prospects of others,

1172
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,819
have you got any clear direction in next

1173
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,969
few exchanges coming? Lawrence: We're

1174
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:26,360
really focused on the platform and while

1175
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,890
Holdings is a commercial

1176
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,310
venture, we're not out there to get lots

1177
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,260
and lots of RHOCs on circulation on

1178
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,930
exchanges. We're really looking to get in

1179
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,420
the hands of developers and

1180
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,490
entrepreneurs and enterprises and others

1181
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,680
who want to use it. That's our primary

1182
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,160
focus, that's where our energy is. So when

1183
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,870
we pursue exchanges, it's really only for

1184
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,330
helping them scale up their technology

1185
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,420
and improving quality of service. Brad: Right,

1186
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,040
so it's not about also trying to

1187
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,560
increase or expedite the process of,

1188
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,270
we've seen this in the past,

1189
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,680
to be frank, is that some of them will

1190
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,970
just go straight through to several

1191
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,860
exchanges very quickly, to really

1192
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,390
hike the price, FOMO the

1193
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,800
market. What I'm hearing from you is

1194
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,510
about utility. I'm hearing that you are

1195
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,400
very much planned on trying to make this

1196
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,620
a real-world project for the future. So,

1197
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,350
let's talk about that specifically. What

1198
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,420
are some of the real-world contexts and

1199
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,170
applications for this as a viable,

1200
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,430
practical, pragmatic business of the

1201
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,400
future? Nash: Pyrofex is going to be

1202
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,170
launching a new product line this year

1203
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,350
to go along with the RChain platform,

1204
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,520
that's going to be an integrated

1205
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,320
development environment for blockchain

1206
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,870
applications. We're gonna have a

1207
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,180
graphical IDE that makes it easy to

1208
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,580
build smart contracts and to deploy them

1209
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,710
seamlessly onto a variety of different

1210
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,020
smart contracting platforms. We want to

1211
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,280
have an App store that helps people

1212
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,680
monetize the smart contracting code that

1213
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,630
they've already written for various

1214
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,820
different blockchains and we want to

1215
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,230
make it easy for people to migrate

1216
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,300
between different blockchains, as their

1217
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,280
application scales. We're not going to

1218
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,440
get tens of thousands of DApps and tens

1219
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,530
of thousands of tokens out there, until

1220
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,030
we have the tools that are

1221
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,580
required in order for people to

1222
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,900
experiment and quickly and easily

1223
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,820
test and see what works and what doesn't.

1224
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,540
And, from an IT perspective,

1225
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,120
all of that works better if you have

1226
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,910
good, easy-to-use tools, that focus on

1227
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,770
migration. It's about

1228
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,900
managing change, both in the enterprise

1229
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,430
environment and the open source

1230
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:31,370
community, wherever you are, the number of

1231
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,960
development tools that exist in order to

1232
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,750
help you manage change is incredible.

1233
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,000
The blockchain environment is so dynamic

1234
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,589
that this is, I think

1235
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,259
one of the biggest missing pieces for

1236
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:45,589
any serious development

1237
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:47,180
team that wants to focus on the

1238
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,099
blockchain. This is a big hole in their

1239
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:50,779
tool chest. Brad: And I think what's impressive

1240
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:53,059
also, just before I come across to you

1241
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:55,219
Lawrence, is that that you are addressing

1242
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:57,200
that hole and I think we need to really

1243
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,059
make that clear, is that, one thing that

1244
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,039
you said in that comment was that

1245
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:02,719
you can't do a certain... you can't

1246
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,119
achieve a minimum of ten thousand DApps

1247
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,440
on your blockchain unless you do these

1248
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,569
things. You're addressing the hole so

1249
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:10,219
that can be a natural

1250
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:11,779
progression. Right now there is no

1251
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:13,579
natural progression. So, Lawrence can you

1252
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:14,749
continue on and please, I'm sorry

1253
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,239
to interrupt. Lawrence: No, no, that's fine, thank you,

1254
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:19,430
and I double down on everything

1255
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,869
Nash said. The other thing is testing

1256
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,630
tools. Nobody's got robust testing tools

1257
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,749
and I've run large consultancies around

1258
00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:28,910
that, that's what I'm investing in,

1259
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,849
oracles, there are lots and lots of

1260
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,920
opportunities, not just for software

1261
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,749
oracles, we're gonna see hardware

1262
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:39,680
oracles, sensors, IOT, we're going very

1263
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,170
big on those. Is it gonna all happen in six

1264
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,650
months? No! I'm a realist. But those are

1265
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:47,599
the things that we want to invest in

1266
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,339
early and those are the things the

1267
00:47:49,339 --> 00:47:52,279
enterprise wants to see, entrepreneurs

1268
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:55,299
are coming back with. Our devices, they do

1269
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,299
telematics in cars, soil monitoring,

1270
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:02,390
I talked to a bank, you know, in South

1271
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,880
America that wants to do that for

1272
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,719
farmers. All of those things are key to

1273
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,900
growth and they demonstrate how well

1274
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,759
RChain will scale, how well it'll get

1275
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:16,279
adopted and that people can make money

1276
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:19,640
off of their hard work and be able to

1277
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,410
grow business and create better lives. I

1278
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,499
mean, I can go on about banking as well,

1279
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:29,229
it's socially conscious banking.

1280
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:31,579
I'm always reluctant to

1281
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,589
talk about names until I've spoken to

1282
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:35,499
the people, but one of the ones that's

1283
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,969
a socially responsible bank,

1284
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:39,559
they're not saying, hey our blockchain is

1285
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,359
going to disrupt it. They want to connect

1286
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,019
to the central banks and then connect

1287
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:47,239
them in third-world countries, like Cora

1288
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:50,059
Network, so I'll use their name. Where

1289
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,559
there isn't strong banking

1290
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,150
infrastructure, people are driving

1291
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,549
across the border with bank transfers

1292
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:58,099
and all they want to do, and I'm

1293
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,380
not trying to oversimplify it, is connect

1294
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,779
them using blockchain technology because

1295
00:49:02,779 --> 00:49:04,880
it's cheaper and easier to run and it

1296
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,270
empowers lives. Those are some of the

1297
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,640
mandates that Greg Meredith put in,

1298
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,319
everybody on the board that you asked

1299
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,460
about, people like Nash, myself, Ed Eykholt

1300
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,829
and others who've really worked very

1301
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,839
hard to build it. Sorry, I'm getting very

1302
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,150
passionate. Brad: No, I think that's great.

1303
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,130
And Lawrence, just to reiterate, I think this

1304
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,900
is important obviously, for my blockchain

1305
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,099
knowledge, is that right from the very

1306
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,930
first iteration of blockchain, the very

1307
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,119
first white paper we saw, we saw the

1308
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,369
premise of circumventing authorities,

1309
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:36,319
circumventing control, circumventing

1310
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,020
enterprise in fact. What is very exciting

1311
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,670
about companies like you, and not to FOMO

1312
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,740
the market by any means, but, is that you

1313
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,809
are addressing a key part of trust and

1314
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,789
identity. Until that is done initially

1315
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,200
and then we address the issue that Nash

1316
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,700
was talking about with the holes, you're not

1317
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,200
actually ever going to enter into

1318
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,240
enterprise market successfully. So

1319
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,130
it appears that your whole team have

1320
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,750
analyzed this very well as a third

1321
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,609
generation blockchain.

1322
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:00,440
And you're approaching it in such a way that it

1323
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,670
does definitely incorporate

1324
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,799
the benefits for enterprise

1325
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:09,109
and also the benefits for the user. And

1326
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:10,520
what else I mean by that, is that

1327
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,740
without those degrees of ID, there's

1328
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,119
certainly no conversation in the

1329
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:15,710
enterprise perspective. Because that has

1330
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,450
to be secure. But is that fair to

1331
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,279
say?

1332
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:21,200
Lawrence: Absolutely! Absolutely! Brad: So, given that

1333
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,730
there are, from my knowledge so few,

1334
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,619
really in the game of ID, in the

1335
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:26,000
blockchain space. I'm gonna be really

1336
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,650
watching you guys to find out which one,

1337
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,720
which partnerships you're making in that

1338
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,089
respect. But in terms of vision, before we

1339
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:33,020
finish off with some special

1340
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,220
announcements hopefully you might give

1341
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,990
us. What's the vision in the next few

1342
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,309
years? You know, what do you look back and

1343
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:38,809
see Nash, with all your technical

1344
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,750
knowledge, what is

1345
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:47,839
RChain in 2020? Nash: I honestly think that if

1346
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,210
we are successful in the next five years

1347
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,859
we're gonna become the world's largest

1348
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:54,109
smart contracting platform and we're

1349
00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:56,990
gonna begin to enable individual end

1350
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,599
users to participate in all the

1351
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,329
types of economic transactions that have

1352
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:03,710
been locked up inside the financial

1353
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,520
system for decades.

1354
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,619
And the democratization of the financial

1355
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,050
system is gonna be really

1356
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,850
incredible and wonderful thing to

1357
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,320
observe and I hope that RChain is a

1358
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,390
really central part of that. Brad: I think just

1359
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,010
the fact you said alone you

1360
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,420
think it's gonna be the world's largest, we're

1361
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,490
talking about serious optimism here.

1362
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,140
Let's talk about the firewall for a moment

1363
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,340
before I go across to Lawrence

1364
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,080
in the same question. The firewall in

1365
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,360
China, this idea of

1366
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,380
this invisible

1367
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,350
blockade that exists

1368
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,850
in many industry, including blockchain.

1369
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,119
How are you going to break through that?

1370
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,369
Nash: Yeah, so it's interesting, we actually

1371
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:41,340
worked out a system last week for

1372
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,500
allowing people to connect and

1373
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,750
disconnect some blockchains from the

1374
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,940
RChain Namespaces, and I think that

1375
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,950
this is really how things are going to

1376
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,230
be implemented in terms of managing

1377
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,210
private and semi-private blockchains

1378
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,040
that are governed differently

1379
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,500
from the main set of Namespaces

1380
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,570
that exist across the world.

1381
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:04,470
Brad: So, we're talking gateways in some way?

1382
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,180
Nash: Yeah, how it exactly gets implemented is gonna be

1383
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,250
sort of open to each individual user but

1384
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,200
we know at this point that what we can

1385
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,810
do is allow people to take

1386
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,130
the Namespaces that they've

1387
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,350
created for themselves and disconnect

1388
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,820
them, go off and run them on their own

1389
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,830
and then bring them back

1390
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,900
So we've seen in the blockchain

1391
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,760
space, you've seen blockchains fork,

1392
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,170
We know what it looks like for

1393
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,270
two chunks of the parties to go their

1394
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,400
separate ways. What we haven't seen yet, is

1395
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,380
we haven't seen two separate parties

1396
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,330
come back together. And that's one of the

1397
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,890
things that we figured out very recently,

1398
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,290
that we can do with Namespaces. It's

1399
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,380
gonna make it possible for the

1400
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,119
Chinese government and their

1401
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,160
society to find ways to make blockchain

1402
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,230
work well for them within whatever

1403
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,359
framework they want to bring to the

1404
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,420
table. We're not here to try to change

1405
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,520
the way that China does business, we're

1406
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,170
just here to try to give them a technology

1407
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,150
that allows them to integrate their

1408
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,470
business with the business of the rest of

1409
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,540
the world, as fairly as possible.

1410
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,090
And, I think we can do that very

1411
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,220
easily with RChain. Brad: I agree and also

1412
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,690
there's a misnomer out there obviously,

1413
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,820
with the ICO event, let's say, in China

1414
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,530
that somehow there's an aversion in

1415
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,300
China for blockchain which is absolute

1416
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,010
nonsense, because they are leading the

1417
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,540
world in fact in many respects with

1418
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,940
their iterations and

1419
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,020
their number of blockchain,

1420
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,720
enterprises and businesses and

1421
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,130
that sort of thing.

1422
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,020
Nash: China is incredibly

1423
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,490
innovative in the way that

1424
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,290
they deploy technology across their

1425
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,180
economy in order to accomplish their

1426
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,460
goals and they have a wonderful way

1427
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,520
of working together in order to

1428
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,950
accomplish society-wide goals that did

1429
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,440
have staggering scale. So when China

1430
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,880
decides to get serious about the

1431
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,710
blockchain and to use it for something,

1432
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,560
use it for applications that

1433
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,869
matter to them, I think it's gonna be an

1434
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:50,580
incredible thing to watch. Brad: Absolutely, I

1435
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,570
mean I can tell you about one example,

1436
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,700
just briefly from my knowledge is they

1437
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,680
are unraveling a one road - one built

1438
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,390
initiative which you may know of, and

1439
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,760
that is of a significant scale in the

1440
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,290
international space, particularly from

1441
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,060
China across through to Europe. We're

1442
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,960
gonna talk about that further at the

1443
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,610
moment but Lawrence if we go across to

1444
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,100
you now and talk about your vision.

1445
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,820
Obviously, you have a different

1446
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,560
perspective being so enterprise focused

1447
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,990
and you're rallying various business

1448
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,360
relationships now. What's your vision,

1449
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,420
you know, for the long term?

1450
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,400
Lawrence: Developers, getting the tools

1451
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,590
into the hands of the developers, so they

1452
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,540
can build things, that we can create an

1453
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,609
ecosystem of education around how the

1454
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:32,460
blockchain should work, how gas pricing

1455
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,400
or as we call it Phlogiston, works to

1456
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,820
build out the chains because the

1457
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,109
ecosystems are gonna be so complicated,

1458
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:43,200
we want to foster that education so that

1459
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,109
then companies, entrepreneurs and

1460
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:48,869
startups can build really massively

1461
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,630
scaled new networks that are outside of

1462
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,790
the traditional system. We've seen some

1463
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,510
spectacular failures in the traditional

1464
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,820
banking system around credit cards with

1465
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,950
MCX.

1466
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:04,410
We have the opportunity to create those

1467
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,550
and add value at all levels and so I see

1468
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,240
us creating the dialogue, delivering on

1469
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,790
standards, driving that with

1470
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,890
other partners, many other partners and

1471
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,540
then having the technology that

1472
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,390
underlies it, to get it executed, this is

1473
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,359
just like the Internet days. How exactly

1474
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:26,850
it's gonna happen, don't know, I'm not

1475
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,780
that smart, I don't think anybody is.

1476
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,549
Brad: I think you certainly are smart, the whole team of RChain

1477
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:34,529
Holdings, the whole team of Pyrofex, it's

1478
00:55:34,529 --> 00:55:37,439
what you're all like, focused on doing in

1479
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:39,689
a unified way is exceptional. It's

1480
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,130
special announcements, I mean, I always

1481
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,069
like to encourage those to come

1482
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:45,869
forth if you can provide any. What's

1483
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:47,009
happening that you want to

1484
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:52,739
release with regard to RChain? Nash: I think

1485
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:53,939
one of the most exciting things that's

1486
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:55,499
going to happen in the next month is

1487
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,209
that the developer team is gonna release

1488
00:55:57,209 --> 00:56:00,359
the first Rholang SDK and we're gonna

1489
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:02,130
launch the developer.rchain.coop

1490
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,199
website to go along with it, so

1491
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:06,929
you'll be able to download the existing

1492
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:08,640
compilers that we've

1493
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,969
written and run them on the Rosette VM.

1494
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:14,099
We're gonna release a

1495
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,140
set of documentation

1496
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,789
associated with that, so people can begin

1497
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:20,309
to familiarize themselves with the Rholang

1498
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:22,829
language as it stands today. We also have

1499
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:25,289
the future looking documentation

1500
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,699
that's associated with our Mercury

1501
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:29,130
release target down towards the end of

1502
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,479
this year, that we're going to be putting

1503
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:32,279
up on that website as well and that's

1504
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:33,509
gonna allow people to see how the

1505
00:56:33,509 --> 00:56:34,859
language will be evolving over the

1506
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,319
course of this year. We're hopeful that

1507
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:38,459
people will come to the website,

1508
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:40,289
developer.rchain.coop, that

1509
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:42,630
they'll download the SDK, they'll play with

1510
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,339
it, they'll learn a little bit of Rho

1511
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,799
Calculus, a little bit about the Rosette

1512
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,779
VM and the Rholang compilers and they'll

1513
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:52,349
have a good time. And you begin to see

1514
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,489
what the potential is for this

1515
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:56,789
interesting new way of writing programs.

1516
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,039
Brad: It's the day of beginning for RChain in a sense. We need to

1517
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,199
really make sure to hell we hit the

1518
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:02,249
nail on the head with that one, because

1519
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:03,749
that's really the beginning as Lawrence

1520
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:05,459
was saying. That's the objective, is to

1521
00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:07,890
try and really get people on board who

1522
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,019
have the skillsets, the developing

1523
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:11,939
skillsets. But let's talk about the specifics,

1524
00:57:11,939 --> 00:57:13,499
we know that Ethereum has its finite

1525
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:16,259
language as well. How difficult is it?

1526
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:18,569
We've seen some of the

1527
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,099
problems and issues with Ethereum,

1528
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,390
with their Solidity

1529
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,329
language design. So how accessible, how

1530
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:29,249
easy and how functional is it? Nash: I think the thing

1531
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:30,719
about Rholang is that it's gonna

1532
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:31,709
be different,

1533
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,359
and so I don't think that Rholang

1534
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,729
is a difficult language. Its syntax is

1535
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:38,729
actually remarkably small, the entire Rho

1536
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:41,309
Calculus fits on about ten lines of

1537
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:44,640
notepad paper. So it's a tiny core to

1538
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,280
describe this model of computation

1539
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,370
and then from there we build up a fairly

1540
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,050
simple programming language for doing

1541
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,020
smart contracts. There will be obviously

1542
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,090
some learning curve associated with the

1543
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:59,000
new syntax and the new semantics of

1544
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,770
learning to program in the Rho Calculus,

1545
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,440
versus Von Neumann machines.

1546
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,710
But we think that a little bit

1547
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,190
of cognitive impedance helps people

1548
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,520
remember the differences and helps stand

1549
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,350
out, and so we're actually really

1550
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,610
hopeful that people are gonna find it to

1551
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,650
be fun and exciting on its own, even

1552
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,450
before the blockchain nodes are

1553
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:23,000
available. And that will

1554
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,800
help them to want to write smart

1555
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,500
contracts for RChain. I'm really, very

1556
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,630
excited for people to get their hands on

1557
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,740
it and just start beginning to learn

1558
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,050
Rholang. Brad: And I wanted to ask both of you,

1559
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,000
because I would love to ask Vitalik if

1560
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,470
he'd ever talk to me as well with the same

1561
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,200
question. Why go and do this

1562
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,320
blockchain specific

1563
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,520
language, developing language. Why not

1564
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,620
open it up to the majority open source

1565
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,590
languages it exists already?

1566
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,400
Nash: Well, actually Rholang is a

1567
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,050
general-purpose programming language and

1568
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,910
the SDK that we're releasing now is

1569
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:56,090
going to be completely agnostic of the

1570
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,490
blockchain. It won't require the node to

1571
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,140
run, it's gonna be possible for you to

1572
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,720
run arbitrary computer programs on it.

1573
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,720
We have designed the language in

1574
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,370
order to facilitate distributed

1575
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,590
computing and that inherently

1576
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,810
facilitates the blockchain, and so it's

1577
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,630
going to be very easy to adapt Rholang

1578
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,210
and the Rosette VMs to run

1579
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,130
within the blockchain nodes and

1580
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:22,190
alongside Casper. And then we're gonna

1581
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,680
implement Casper in Rholang, also we're

1582
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,240
gonna eat our own dog food over the

1583
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,100
course of the next year and we think

1584
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,570
that there's very little that we could

1585
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,700
do to prove that how confident we are in

1586
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,620
the language design and in the virtual

1587
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,540
machine, than to actually implement the

1588
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,220
consensus algorithm in our own

1589
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,050
programming language. Brad: Fascinating,

1590
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:40,340
when I hear you both speak,

1591
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,840
particularly you Nash, with your technological

1592
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,030
prowesses is, that really

1593
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,740
essentially in many ways, bit like me,

1594
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,770
with me being a NEO nerd. Really, you guys,

1595
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:51,860
you had that connotation or at the

1596
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,150
moment, currently as

1597
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,310
technologically nerds of the space. But

1598
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,380
what I mean by that is, that you're not

1599
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,480
well-known beyond that and I really hope

1600
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,050
that we can

1601
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,580
really push this forth into the

1602
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,950
mainstream space. Because you really are

1603
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,600
so much more than a

1604
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,480
technologically savvy team. You are

1605
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,760
building out a very robust team prepared

1606
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,350
for business, and that's why I like

1607
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,670
talking to you, because you're a really,

1608
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,380
essentially a business blockchain. You're

1609
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,360
all business. End of the bedrock

1610
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,430
is the technology. So I really appreciate

1611
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,480
the time that you've taken today, I

1612
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,040
understand you're both extremely busy as

1613
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,260
CEOs of a holding company with the

1614
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,640
RChain Holding company. Thank you so much

1615
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,930
Lawrence Lerner, I appreciate your time

1616
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,240
today. Thank you so much Nash, appreciate

1617
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,440
your time. I know that you're leading a

1618
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,690
team of 15 very smart people, certainly

1619
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,520
smarter than me. And hopefully we can

1620
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,590
talk again, and I'll be really

1621
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,630
excited to follow the journey that

1622
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,150
RChain is going to build out in

1623
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,460
the next few years.

1624
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,590
Lawrence: Love to. Thank you so much. Nash: Thanks for

1625
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,590
having us on.
